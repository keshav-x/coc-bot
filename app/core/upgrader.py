'''Auto-maxer orchestration: scan the builder popup, decide an upgrade, and start it.

:class:`UpgradeAdvisor` drives the bot's own services (window/input/vision/config) the
same way the wall flow does: open the builder popup from the home screen, wheel-scroll
through the whole list while parsing each position (:mod:`app.core.upgrade_menu`),
merge the rows, close the popup, and run the policy (:mod:`app.core.upgrade_policy`).

Execution (``maxer``/``rusher`` modes): re-open the popup, locate the picked row by
fuzzy label + exact cost (two consecutive frames must agree on its y before the click —
the list keeps easing after a wheel nudge and stale coordinates click whatever slid
underneath), then hunt the "Upgrade" button by OCR. The word-hunt is deliberately
layout-agnostic: clicking a row may select the building (bottom-bar Upgrade button),
open a hero/building screen, or jump straight to the confirm dialog — all of them
surface an "Upgrade" word in the bottom band, and clicking it walks the chain (at most
two hops) to the green confirm. Every uncertain frame is dumped to
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\BasePilot\\debug\\upgexec_*.jpg`` and every abort escapes via
exit/empty-tap — never a blind confirm (gem guard: a red cost zone under the word
vetoes the click).

Success is verified by the builder chip: free builders must drop below the pre-click
reading. ``dry`` mode still only logs its decision.
