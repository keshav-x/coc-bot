'''Home-village state snapshot for the auto-maxer's idle gate and the UI status panel.

Reads everything the home screen shows about "is there anything productive to do":
free builders (top-HUD builder chip), laboratory research slots (flask chip left of
it), and full gold/elixir storages (the hero-bar full-storage icons). All fields are
Optional — a chip that is absent or unreadable yields ``None``, never a guess, so the
caller can be conservative. TH-agnostic by construction: villages without a lab (or
with fewer builders) simply read as ``None`` / smaller totals.

The Pet House has NO home-screen indicator (verified on live TH15 frames: a busy pet
upgrade appears neither as a HUD chip nor as a builder-popup in-progress row), so pet
state is not tracked here — pets remain a manual job and never block idling.
