'''Upgrade policy for the auto-maxer: which upgrade to start, given the parsed
builder menu, OCR'd resources, and free builders.

Maxer and rusher are one engine with different rules — not two bots:
- maxer: never touches the Town Hall row; spends on everything else, cheapest first.
- rusher: takes the Town Hall the moment it is affordable; otherwise cheapest first.

Shared invariants: keep ``reserve_builders`` free (walls are the overflow sink for
the reserved builder — the existing wall flow handles those), and keep a gold buffer
so the Find a Match entry fee is never spent away.
